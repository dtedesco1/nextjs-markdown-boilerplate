## But it doesn't stop there...

We can add client side interactive React components:

<TallyButton />


### Conway's Game of Life

<ConwayGame />

## And server side components...

The code for this whole page is just markdown with React components whenever I want more dynamic content (shown below using a server side component):

<RenderHomepageCode />
