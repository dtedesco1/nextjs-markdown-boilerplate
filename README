# Next.js 15 Markdown Boilerplate

A minimal Next.js 15 application that renders content from Markdown files, styled with Tailwind CSS.

It's just markdown files in a `app/content` directory. The file name becomes the URL path. You can add React components to the markdown directly.

## Features

- Render Markdown files as pages
- Add React components anywhere in the Markdown
- Global styles using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

## How to use it

I'm lazy, so I made this extremely simple.

### Pages

Just write some markdown in a `.mdx` file.

```mdx
# My Page

This is my page.
```

### Routing

Add new pages by creating `.mdx` files in the `app/content` directory. The file name becomes the URL path:

- `app/content/index.mdx` → `/`
- `app/content/a-beautiful-page.mdx` → `/a-beautiful-page`
- `app/content/more-content/another-page.mdx` → `/more-content/another-page`

### React Components

Add custom React components to the `components` directory. Then, import them at the top of an MDX file and use them like any other React component.

```mdx
import MyComponent from '../components/my-component'

<MyComponent />
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- TypeScript

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit <http://localhost:3000>

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Project Structure

I tried to make this as simple as possible, given the constraints of modern web development.
